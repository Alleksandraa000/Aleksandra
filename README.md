# Aleksandra Ola

I am a graduate of Tourism and Recreation from the University School of Physical Education in Pozna≈Ñ. I have over four years of experience working in a travel tech startup, where at the position of Assistant Manager and an Airline Ticket Agent. Currently, I work as a Senior Support Associate in Operations Team at Sollers Consulting, where I handle the organization of business trips.

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in customer service, data analysis, and collaboration with product and sales teams. Due to the dynamic nature of startups, I had the opportunity to participate in the design of a reservation system at various stages, including the conceptual development and active testing of new functionalities. This experience allowed me to develop technical skills in software testing.

I find technology fascinating and want to develop my skills in the area of quality assurance. I plan to obtain the ISTQB certification and am participating in the "Manual Tester" training at Coders Lab. I aim to master technologies such as SQL, Postman, and Git.

Although I haven't created any projects yet, I plan to add them in the near future as I acquire more skills in manual testing and the technologies I plan to master.
